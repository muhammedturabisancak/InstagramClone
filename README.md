I made an Instagram clone application where the user, for whom I created a database with Firebase, first registers and then logs in, uploads photos from the phone's album, sees photos of himself or other users and interacts with those photos with likes.

In my application; 
Registration and login screen
Share upload screen
It has a screen where it sees and interacts with time-aligned and updated posts.
